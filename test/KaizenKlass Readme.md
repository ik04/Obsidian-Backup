# About The Project

![[KK.png]]

the Purpose of this project is to build a community of people who are willing to collaborate and help each other out with the ever pressing issue of assignments, for me personally i feel that i don't learn much from them and they pile up on me which does nothing to alleviate my stress, 
i have a few reasons as to why i am building this:

- i suck at tracking assignments and often end up missing them entirely which costs me in the future
- i'm unable to efficiently track the weightage of the assignments and how much they matter
- i end up submitting late

i know that this problem isn't limited to myself and so i want to build a platform to combat these issues. i'll also creep in festures to help out students generally as well as point them to organizations that can help them grow, in my opinion the only reason we do assignments is to get by and get marks. Its a waste of our time and its better invested in protecting our careers via upskilling.
Join the Community and make life easier for everyone involved :)
