- [x] Binary Parallel adder/subtractor
- [x] Binary Multi (make notes)
- [ ] unsigned
- [ ] Signed
- [ ] Fast 
- [ ] Carry 
- [ ] Save
- [ ] Addition of summands

- [x] IEEE 754 Floating point numbers and operations. skip

## Unit 2: (finish then go back to unit 3):
- [ ] RTN 
- [ ] data transfer instructions
- [ ] data manipulation instructions
- [ ] arithematic instructions
- [ ] shift
- [ ] instruction formats
- [ ] one address instruction
- [ ] two address instruction
- [ ] three address instruction
- [ ] instruction cycle
- [ ] straight line sequencing
- [ ] condition codes
- [ ] addressing modes
- [ ] microprocessors (from here return to unit 3)




## PLAN: 
math = unit 3, finish unit 3 base today and do unit 2 sat (main day), revise sunday
- [ ] Unit 3 first 
- [ ] Unit 2 after confirming syllabus
- [ ] revise unit 3
- [ ] revise unit 2
- [ ] attempt papers and practice
