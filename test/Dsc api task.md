## Task:
Create a web-based Library Catalog Management System that
allows librarians to manage their library's collection of books, magazines,
and other materials. The system will provide a RESTful API for performing
CRUD operations on library catalogue entries.
Make sure to design the API with clean and intuitive endpoints that
are easy to use, follow standard RESTful practices and comprehensive
documentation for all your endpoints.
All entries must be saved on any database (used: sqlite)

## Overview:
This is a simple library management system where you can add any type of material and assign it to a category, you can then manipulate the data in a few ways.

- With this you'll have everything you'll need to run my project 

## Api Endpoints:
this api has been made in accordance to the task and so it dosen't store every detail so as to streamline the testing process, it has also been made to easily work with a frontend.

healthcheck and init:
- api/v1/healthcheck-and-init (route to check if the api is workign and to initialize the db with a few categories)

Category routes:
- api/v1/add-category (add categories using this route, will explain in usage) **POST**

- api/v1/delete-book (delete books in the db) **POST**
- api/v1/update-book-category (update the category of any book, this is the only field since you can't change the name of a book in an actual library XD) **POST**
## Initialize:
- After installing and setting up laravel and composer run:
```bash
composer install
