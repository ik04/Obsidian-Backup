## Note to Self: 
- I Realize now that they might focus more on my cgpa and that i should work on recovering it, i will do that right away and make sure i don't get detained in the wrong subs so that these assholes can't barr me from placements. I don't wanna suffer cuz of this i will prevent it. I WILL STOP AVOIDING STESSFUL THINK AND EAT THE FROG AND FUCKING WORK, i will dedicate a section to this to make it happend. put dev on hold to make this happend so your future dosen't hang in the balance (but don't lose the dev flame).
