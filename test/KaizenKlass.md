## Spitballin and ideas:
- manual assignment integ (make a portal for this which only i can access (hard code creds))
- upload solutions in solutions section
- get solutions form others through (make a different portal that only allows only solutions that too queue) (creep later)
- better card ui design 
- framer animation integ (future)
- ## group by years (after current sem, feature creep)
- years table (get all possible subjects to make it usable by anyone)
- karma feature (feature creep)
- integrate llama to check code snippet validity (feature creep)
- roles (krosscheckers, admin, kontributors)
- only one login portal for all accs and accs to be made manually
- illama or gpt integration for better answers
- register as contributer today?
- contribution stats in profile page
- add profile pic (feature creep)
- switch to postgres or mysql
- report (far far future)

- [ ] tanstack query
- [x] test out content field
- [x] cron job to delete files once assigments are deleted
- [ ] test update routes
- [ ] content table to allow more than one file 

## Routes to make:
- [x] get assigments by subject
- [x] get solutions by assignment (map user too)
- [ ] test the routes/try out phpunit?
